# Assignment Overview:

The Octodex is a fun way to celebrate a powerful tool we use for development. In that same spirit, recreate [this site](https://octodex.github.com/)

You'll identify the main `Component`s on the page and create React components for each, breaking down those `Component`s into smaller ones as needed.

## Objectives

- Learn to identify parts of a web site as `Component`s
- Use `app-app` (GAMMA stack) to build a React project
- Understand and use React components

## Stretch Objectives

- Understand and use "props" in React

### Explorer Mode

- [x] Create your React app using `app-app` `GAMMA`
- [x] If you have done the non-React version of octodex, use your existing HTML as the `render()` method of your `App` component. Otherwise, figure out the main components of the page and implement the `render()` method of `App`
- [x] Your CSS should be in `index.css` -- feel free to copy your previous project's css if you have done the non-React version of this assignment.
- [x] You should have at _least_ two components... (Hint, perhaps Header, and an Octocat)
- [x] Use props to try to reuse components (reuse the Octocat component)

### Adventure Mode

- [x] Place the definition of each Octocat in an `array` of objects and use `map` to generate the Octocat components

### Epic Mode

- [x] Put the `array` of Octocats in an `octocats.json` file and `import` that into your app.
- _OR_
- [ ] Use the `fetch` API to retrieve the list of Octocats from [this api](https://sdg-octodex.herokuapp.com/) instead
